            Hello, I'm Ayoub Lahyaoui a {getAge()}-year-old Belgian computer science student currently completing an end-of-study internship at TomTom in Mobile Development.<br />
            I enjoy socializing, meeting new people, and learning about different cultures, which leads me to enjoy traveling.<br />
            I have been fortunate to visit a few countries and hope to visit more in the future.<br />
            As a computer and technology enthusiast, I've developed a wide range of skills in a variety of computer-related fields, making me a highly adaptable individual. <br />
            I strive to make use of all of my abilities but also to acquire new ones in order to help me complete my work as efficiently as possible.
